# 🌦️ Weather Realm

**[Live Demo](https://weatherealm.netlify.app/)**

A fun 3D project I built while learning **React**. Instead of a boring table of numbers, I wanted to see if I could make the weather actually look "eye-appealing" using low-poly models.

## ✨ The Vibe
**Weather Realm** is all about the visuals. I used **React Three Fiber** to create a dynamic environment that changes based on what's happening in the real world.

* **☀️ Day Mode:** A clean, animated low-poly sun.
* **🌙 Night Mode:** A chill, glowing moon scene.
* **💡 Real-time Lighting:** The scene lighting shifts automatically based on the city's sunrise and sunset.

## 🛠️ Tech I Used
* **React** — My main tool for building the interface and logic.
* **React Three Fiber** — How I got the 3D models into the browser.
* **Tailwind CSS** — Used for a clean, modern, and responsive layout.
* **Open-Meteo API** — Where the weather data comes from (no API keys needed!).

## 📱 Features & Usage
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout adapts to any screen size, from desktop monitors to mobile phones.
* **Search & Explore:** Enter any city name to see the realm swap between the **Sun** and the **Moon** based on that city's local time.
* **Save Favorites:** Use the **Settings** menu to keep your most-searched locations handy.

## 🧠 Learning React
This project was basically my "playground" for learning **React**. It was a funny experience because I didn't just stick to the basics—I decided to throw **3D models** into the mix right away. 

Figuring out how to make React talk to the **Open-Meteo API** and then using that data to switch 3D scenes was a "nice one" for me. It was a great way to learn how **State** works by literally watching a Sun turn into a Moon when the data changed. It was a fun way to get my hands dirty with code and see what React is capable of.
